# phrint (/prÉªnt/)

Simple and visual state testing for PHP programming. Works well when checking if data is returned by a method and/or quickly figuring out the data type. The p method is particularily useful for temporarily displaying data on an html page instead of writing it to the database. This is especially effective in combination with [livereload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/livereload) and the livereload browser extension, so you can work on your controller/model while seeing the returned result update everytime you save.

## Installation
### Install with Composer
```
$ composer require lsmj/phrint --dev
```
Uninstall:
```
$ composer remove lsmj/phrint --dev
```
## Usage
### Auto-load and import class
Require Composer's autoload.php if you're not using a framework that already takes care of this, like Laravel. Import the class with `use lsmj\phrint`.

index.php:
```php
<?php

require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

use lsmj\phrint;
```
public/index.php:
```php
<?php

require_once('../vendor/autoload.php');

use lsmj\phrint;
```
## Methods
---
### p (print)
Prints the input preformatted on a bleached yellow background. Especially useful when tracking state types or data. Objects are JSON encoded.

`p(array $input)`

Code example:
```php
$arr = [1, 2, 3];
phrint::p($arr);
```
Result:
```
Type: array
Array
(
    [0] => 1
    [1] => 2
    [2] => 3
)
```

---

### m (message)
Prints the input preformatted on a bleached yellow background. Useful when printing messages that needs to be easy to find visually.

`m(string $input)`

---

### l (list)
Explodes and prints a comma-seperated string as a vertical list on a bleached yellow background. This is useful for viewing or counting elements (like in a CSV heading), creating a new array from the list, manipulating the element names or copying and pasting the resulting list into a spreadsheet.

`l(string $input, [string $delimiter = "'"], [string $remove_string = null])`

Code example:
```php
$str = 'a,b,c';
phrint::l($str);
```
Result:
```
1
2
3
```
The default delimiter is `,` but a different one can be passed as the second argument. The third argument is an optional `regex` function that replaces the given input string with an empty string.

Code example:
```php
$str = 'col-a.col-b.col-c';
phrint::l($str, '.', 'col-');
```
Result:
```
a
b
c
```
